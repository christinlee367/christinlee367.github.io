### Tri 3 TPT 1.0 Computing Bias 5.3
Watch the video... HP computers are racist
Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
1. Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
I don't think they thought it was intentional because he did not want it to be this way either. 
If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
He had shown his friend as well in light that he doesn't think the acts done by the peopel around his are not done with bad intention.
How do you think this happened?
Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
It is definetely harmful to exclude one so we should not follow in pursuit of this misconduct. 
Should it be corrected?
This shoudl be corrected in hopes of people in the future to not misunderstand of this intential bias.
What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
To produce a better outcome, I would work to ensure equality for everyone.

### Tri 3 TPT 1.1 Crowdsourcing 5.4
CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
We can use the power of freidnnship and communication to work together in creating a wonderful project.
What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
yes because it has the perspectives of many different people.

5.3: Computing Bias
Explicit Data: data that you voluntarily give to companies
Thumbs
Name, address…
Implicit Data: 
When you watch
What you binge(d)
Style of show frequently selected
Computing innovations can reflect existing tendencies
Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development

5.4: Crowdsourcing
Citizen Science
Describes scientific research that the common population helps to conduct. Ordinary citizens help contribute data to research projects using computing devices. 
Citizen science gives a wide range of people the ability to contribute to scientific studies and, in turn, provides more diverse data for scientists to work with.
Crowdsourcing 
Practice of getting a large amount of input or information from people on the Internet.
Citizen science is an example of crowdsourcing, but crowdsourcing can also take other forms.
Crowdsourcing can also take the form of financial support in a process known as crowdfunding like GoFundMe

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
    It is still astounding that we must still require a human response to answer our most important calls. it would be better to combine this trust with machine learning. Based on the flow chart, it is also a complicated process that is not fault-tolerant at all, but it is extremely realistic. Sometimes when making important calls such as job offers, can impact my personal study and success in High School negatively.

#### 5.2 GitHub pages action -- Digital Empowerment
***
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
    Empowerment in the digital world is important because it assists organizations in opening up the knowledge, experience and values that people already have. Through resources such as slack and github, students like me can express their unique talent through these tools. Then being is linked is what is important and makes our work known.

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
   Build trust. At times, it is necessary that we trust others to complete specific tasks or own certain goals without much oversight, Ask for feedback, Offer instructions. For places such as the nighthawk center, it allows students to have a safe space where they can relax. Equip with many helpful mentors and other students, they are able to gain help to be empowered in a digital world over there.

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
Red tape is particularly burdensome to smaller businesses and may act as a disincentive to new business start-ups. Paper is definitely now blocking digital empowerment because it allows people to print and put their work on paper making it easier for others to see visually and be more accessible to those who do not have a computer device.
