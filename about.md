2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
    It is still astounding that we must still require a human response to answer our most important calls. it would be better to combine this trust with machine learning. Based on the flow chart, it is also a complicated process that is not fault-tolerant at all, but it is extremely realistic. Sometimes when making important calls such as job offers, can impact my personal study and success in High School negatively.

#### 5.2 GitHub pages action -- Digital Empowerment
***
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
    Empowerment in the digital world is important because it assists organizations in opening up the knowledge, experience and values that people already have. Through resources such as slack and github, students like me can express their unique talent through these tools. Then being is linked is what is important and makes our work known.

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
   Build trust. At times, it is necessary that we trust others to complete specific tasks or own certain goals without much oversight, Ask for feedback, Offer instructions. For places such as the nighthawk center, it allows students to have a safe space where they can relax. Equip with many helpful mentors and other students, they are able to gain help to be empowered in a digital world over there.

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
Red tape is particularly burdensome to smaller businesses and may act as a disincentive to new business start-ups. Paper is definitely now blocking digital empowerment because it allows people to print and put their work on paper making it easier for others to see visually and be more accessible to those who do not have a computer device.
